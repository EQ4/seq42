<0.0.1>
[x] Refactor top-level window (mainwnd) so that it contains the song 
    (aka "performance") editor (perfedit) instead of the pattern grid (mainwid).
[x] Removed a lot of live looping stuff (like mute groups, queuing, etc)
[x] Added loop toggle kb shortcut
[x] Refactor data structures and UI such that a performance has a list
    of "tracks".  Split some of the seq24 sequence class out into track.
    Track should have a midi port and channel, name, mute status, and a list of
    sequences.  Sequence should no longer have midi port and channel; instead
    it should send midi data to its track's port and channel.
    Will also need to update file saving and loading.

[x] Change seqedit such that there is a button (use midi.xpm) that opens the
    track edit window

[x] Add function to trigger menu to copy an existing sequence (from any track)

[x] Add function to mute all tracks, unmute all tracks, and toggle/invert
    the mute status of all tracks.  (see existing perform::mute_all_tracks)

[ ] Add to Edit menu a new action "View sequence list" which opens a new window
    with a TreeView widget of all tracks.  Each track can be expanded to list 
    all of the sequences.  Right-clicking a sequence pops up a menu with 
    options to Edit and Delete.  When Delete is selected, check if the sequence 
    is assigned to at least one trigger... if so, ask the user if they're sure.

[ ] Add to Edit menu a new action "Delete all untriggered sequences"

[ ] Add to Edit menu a new action "Pack track list" (shifts all active tracks 
    to the top of the track list).  After this change, change the file save 
    format such that each active track in the file includes an index int. 
    Loading a file should put each track back in the same slot (allowing for
    empty slots b/w tracks).

[ ] Enhance perform-level undo/redo such that all perform/track level changes
    can be undone/redone: adding a track, cutting/copying/pasting a track, editing a track.
    This would require a more sophisticated approach.
    Current approach pushes state of all triggers for all active tracks onto an undo stack.
    Instead would need to create some sort of "action memento" objects that contain enough
    infomation to be able to call the appropriate methods to undo the last change.

[ ] Get rid of all the "dirty" stuff.  Instead make perform keep track 
    of the open windows.  It can then notify them whenever a specific track
    or sequence has changed.  Perform could also maintain a pointer to the 
    background sequence (for seqedit and seqroll), and be sure to set it to
    null if the sequence is deleted.

[ ] Add m_modified bool to perform (and possibly also sequence and track).
    Set to True as soon as anything is modified.
    Add an is_modified() method that returns m_modified.
    Update mainwnd is_modified() to take perform's is_modified() into account.
    Alternatively (if undo/redo is made more robust).... ditch all the modified stuff and look at the size of the
    undo stack to determine whether or not save dialog is needed.

[ ] Add option to Load dialog and method that appends the tracks of a file to the current
    performance.  Handy for copying sequences from another song.  You could even have a 
    file that contains re-usable sequences (like various drum rolls or CC patterns).

Seq24 stuff below......

<0.9.0>

[sequence editor]

[X] Ctrl Z undo seq + perf
[x] Ctrl + select = adds to selection (roll + event) m_seq->unselect
[X] Window Raise on Edit 
[x] Static clipboard share
[X] Do not use selected for internal stuff
[X] Midi items are not de-selected after actions are taken (copy too)
[x] Paste buffer shouldn't clear
[x] paint notes
[x] paint events

[x] Port Names and number specd in rc file 
[x] Controllers Speced in rc file eg. (Wavestation MIDI 1) (SuperNova Filter)
[ ] Notes Speced in rc file eg. Bass Drum (no black/white)

[ ] Scroll on dragging ?
[ ] Event mute ?
[x] Stretch w/ Ctrl (Federico)
[ ] Change background sequence color


[x] Test Maxim Patches w/ wheel mouse
    Make sure data entry still does its thing w/ wheel

 1) when clicking on an event only one (the "topmost") event is selected.
 useful to decouple two events that are eventually stocked on top one another
 2) if there are any events selected, data editor only changes controller.
 values for these events; if there are no events selected it acts as usual.
 3) data editor slope line can be dragged outside of data editor window;
 controller values are adjusted to fit (0,127).
 makes it easier setting all controllers to min/max value.
 4) mouse wheel scrolls the grid up/down in sequence editor and song editor.
